# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

* **Search & Filter:** Find specific jobs by title, company, or location.
* **Job Details View:** Click on any job to see a detailed description, salary, and company information.
* **User Authentication (Optional):** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their job applications.
* **Responsive Design:** A seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üíª Technologies Used

### Frontend
* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Router:** For handling navigation within the application.
* **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

### Backend
* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
* **Express.js:** A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing job data.
* **Mongoose:** An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool.
* **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** For secure user authentication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd my-awesome-jobs-app
    ```

2.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../backend  # Navigate back to the root, then into the backend folder
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:**
    ```
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=a_strong_secret_key
    ```
    * You can get your MongoDB connection string from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or your local MongoDB instance.
    * For `JWT_SECRET`, use a long, random string.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev  # or npm start
    ```

2.  **Start the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start
    ```

3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.
